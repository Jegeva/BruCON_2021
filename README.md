#BruCON 2021

This is the firmware and pcb for brucon badge as of
released at the conference 

ie. including :

*the mistake that needs a bodge (vbat to the sensor, backlights and leds missing a bit of trace) and 
*the mistake with the connector (don't use the one refed in the kicad docs, it is keyed down instead of up)
